This repository uses [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/) to generate a series of static html pages from markdown. Both the input content and the output html are included in this repository. 

Theme on [flasky](https://github.com/fjavieralba/flasky), and modified to make it less blog-focused and more suitable for an academic portfolio (including the addition of [academicons](http://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/#)). 

## Usage

The raw markdown content and pdfs are placed in the `content` folder. Generate the output html by running `pelican` in the top-level directory. The contents of `output` are hosted at `http://cheynehomberger.com`.
