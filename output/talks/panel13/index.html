    <!-- <p class=date> Tue 29 October 2013 </p> -->
    <p>Graduate Student Research Day, University of Florida, October 29nd, 2013</p>
<p>Team building panel I organized and moderated at UF's Graduate Student Research 
Day, sponsored by <a href="http://i3.institutes.ufl.edu/">I-Cubed</a>. Details can be found 
<a href="http://i3.institutes.ufl.edu/graduate-student-advisory-council/events/2013-graduate-student-research-day-schedule/building-a-cohesive-team-2013-graduate-research-day/">here</a>, 
and are copied below:</p>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Students must learn to work in teams during their graduate student careers, and 
upon graduation, often are expected to build and lead their own teams. Building 
teams that are cohesive and work together to efficiently achieve their goals can 
be difficult. In this session, a panel with an extensive background in 
leadership roles and team management discusses insights learned from their 
experiences and is available to answer pressing graduate student questions.</p>
<h3>Moderator</h3>
<p>Cheyne Homberger is a fifth year PhD student in mathematics. He has been 
actively involved in mentoring during his time at UF, working to establish the 
graduate student mentoring award, and a math department mentoring program for 
incoming graduate students. He has worked with I-Cubed for three years, serving 
as Co-Chair from January 2012 to February of 2013.</p>
<h3>Speakers</h3>
<p><em>Wendy-Lin Bartels</em></p>
<p>Wendy-Lin Bartels is an Assistant Research Scientist with the Florida Climate 
Institute and the Southeast Climate Consortium at the University of Florida.<br />
Her research assesses the conditions and mechanisms that facilitate 
collaboration among diverse stakeholders.  Specifically, she examines 
interactions among scholars and practitioners (such as farmers, water managers 
and foresters) for the co-development of relevant climate information to support 
decision making. Wendy-Lin is currently exploring the value of learning networks 
as venues for iterative dialog around adaptive responses to changes in climate. 
Wendy-Lin is also collaborating with Brazilian partner universities and NGOs to 
deliver leadership training field courses through her affiliation with the 
Amazon Conservation Leadership Institute (ACLI).  Courses build skills in 
collaborative process management and use experiential learning methods and team 
work to cultivate greater understanding of the diversity among actors that 
constitute frontier landscapes in the Amazon.  Wendy-Lin graduated from UF with 
a PhD in interdisciplinary ecology and a Master’s in science communication.  She 
is a native South African and holds a Bachelor of Science in botany and 
molecular genetics from Stellenbosch University.</p>
<p><em>Jonathan Dain</em></p>
<p>Jonathan Dain is Curriculum Director for the Florida Natural Resources 
Leadership Institute (NRLI), a UF/IFAS Extension program focused on 
collaborative approaches to managing contentious natural resource issues.  The 
mission of NRLI is to create a state-wide network of natural resource 
professionals trained in conflict management and participatory approaches to 
decision-making. He is also a Lecturer at UF’s Center for Latin American Studies 
where he serves as a core faculty member in both the Tropical Conservation and 
Development (TCD) and the Masters of Sustainable Development Practice (MDP) 
programs.  Jon teaches graduate classes in conflict management, facilitation, 
leadership and communication skills.  An applied anthropologist by training and 
a certified mediator, he began his career almost 30 years ago as a Peace Corps 
Volunteer in Paraguay.  He continues to work in Latin America with a focus on 
Brazil and more recently, Mexico.</p>
