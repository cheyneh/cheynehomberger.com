### About Me
I recently finished my doctoral degree at the University of Florida under Dr 
Miklós Bóna. My research centers on enumerative and analytic combinatorics, with 
a focus on permutation patterns and lattice paths. I'm currently working in 
operations research and data science in the Washington, DC area, and serving as 
adjunct faculty at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County
