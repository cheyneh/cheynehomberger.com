### About Me
I'm currently working in data science and operations research in the Washington, 
DC area, and serving as adjunct faculty at the University of Maryland, Baltimore 
County
My academic research interests center on enumerative and analytic combinatorics, 
with a focus on permutation patterns and lattice paths, while my professional 
interests lie in machine learning and data visualization.
I conducted my doctoral research at the University of Florida with
[Miklós Bóna](http://people.clas.ufl.edu/bona/).
