## Abstract:
A permutation class is said to be deflatable if its simple permutations are 
contained within a proper subclass. Deflatable classes are often easier to 
describe, analyze, and enumerate than their non-deflatable counterparts. This 
paper presents theorems guaranteeing the non-deflatability of principal classes, 
constructs an infinite family of deflatable principal classes, and 
provides examples of each.
