## Abstract:
We consider the enumeration of pattern-avoiding involutions, focusing in 
particular on sets defined by avoiding a single pattern of length 4. As we 
demonstrate, the numerical data for these problems demonstrates some surprising 
behavior. This strange behavior even provides some very unexpected data related 
to the number of 1324-avoiding permutations.
