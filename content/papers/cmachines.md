## Abstract:

We investigate a generalization of stacks that we call $\C$-machines. We show 
how this viewpoint rapidly leads to functional equations for the classes of 
permutations that $\C$-machines generate, and how these systems of functional 
equations can frequently be solved by either the kernel method or, much more 
easily, by guessing and checking.  General results about the rationality, 
algebraicity, and the existence of Wilfian formulas for some classes generated 
by $\C$-machines are given.  We also draw attention to some relatively small 
permutation classes which, although we can generate thousands of terms of their 
enumerations, seem to not have D-finite generating functions.
