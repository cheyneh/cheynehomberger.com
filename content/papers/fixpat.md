## Abstract:

We consider the problem of packing fixed-length patterns into a permutation, and 
develop a connection between the number of large patterns and the number of 
bonds in a permutation. Improving upon a result of Kaplansky and Wolfowitz, we 
obtain exact values for the expectation and variance for the number of large 
patterns in a random permutation. Finally, we are able to generalize the idea of 
bonds to obtain results on fixed-length patterns of any size, and present a 
construction that maximizes the number of patterns of a fixed size.
